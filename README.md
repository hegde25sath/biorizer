# biorizer
A text summarizer that also outputs a summary using bionic reading - which highlights certain segments of text to make it faster to read.

# Description

Works with pdf files (and probably only single page) only currently, need to drag them into the Java project directory. Needs the PdfBox Java jar to run. Requires pandoc library to be installed. 

May have to change a few lines to work on your machine as it was quickly built for my personal MacOS.
